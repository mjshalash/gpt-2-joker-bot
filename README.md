GPT-2 Modification for humourous joke generation

* Warning, as of right now the only dataset I have been able to acquire has been from kaggle.
* The training data is downloaded from kaggle which got it from scraping the /r/jokes subreddit
* Thus it contains very innapropriate content. I am working diligently to not rely soley on this dataset but to
* look for others and clean the kaggle one as best as possible.
*Generating innapropriate jokes is, and will never, be the intention of this AI*
